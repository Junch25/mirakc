# GitHub Workflows

This folder contains definitions of GitHub workflows.

Some of them are generated by running the following command in the project root
directory:

```sh
./scripts/make-github-workflows
```

Template files used in the script are found in the [templates](./templates)
folder.

The script uses `docker` and the `docker.io/mikefarah/yq` image in order to
merge template files into a single YAML file.
